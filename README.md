# Build APIs You Wont Hate

This is my personal repository that I use to follow with the examples on the book ["Build APIs You Won't Hate" on LeanPub](http://apisyouwonthate.com). I forked it from the [original repo by Phil Sturgeon](https://github.com/philsturgeon/build-apis-you-wont-hate)

## Rest of the original readme

Some chapters are just theory, and some chapters will have sections that rely on sample code. 
I have tried to avoid making this a book of code, and it's intended to be language 
agnostic, but a book without any concrete examples would just be a hand-wavey joke. 

So, please find enclosed Laravel + PHP based example applications in many chapters, and in 
`chapter11` I have a simple little [API Blueprint] example that you can use with [Aglio].
